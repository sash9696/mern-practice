// UI => Data (ui in sync with the data)

// document.getElementById('body').innerHTML = 'dklasmd'

//reflow or repaint

//react

//react dom

//use in memory data structure
//

// dom  => virtual dom (object (in memory))

//only that part taht has changed
//react will manipulate the actual dom for only that part of the tree




//dom manipulation will be handled by react
//more data centric applications


//state management

// track of lot of variables

//react has its inbuilt state management system (closures)

//componentization
//every piece of ui can be converted to a component

//code maintainability , readibility


//Does that mean we should not use vanilla js?

//small size , static applications 
//vanilla js is a lot faster






// server (html , js)  => client

//server  => api  => data => client (html, js )

// Next js

//ssr
//csr
//static rendering


//node js => c++ + libuv
